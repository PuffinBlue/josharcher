In addition to the [Odin Project](/categories/odin-project/) I've decided to simultaneously undertake the [Learn Python The Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/) course by Zed Shaw.

Learning two things at once might sound overkill but spending 6 hours plus a day on one topic can just lead to burnout. So, with a range of things to cover, I hope to spread out the brain pain and probably learn a little faster or more deeply than I would otherwise. 

### Keep up with updates

I'll be blogging after each completed exercise with the a full copy of the completed lessons. I'm usually fairly verbose in the comments for each project so you migght find answers you are otherwise struggling with. 

To keep up to date with my progress, check out the [LPTHW](/categories/lpthw/) category.
