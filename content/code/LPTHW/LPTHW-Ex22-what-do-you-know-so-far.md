[LPTHW - Exercise 22](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex22.html)

No code or study drill in this lesson. Today we'll be going back over everything we've done so far and make sure we know what every little bit does/means.

To do that we're going to go back through each lesson and identify every keyword or symbol that we've used. Then we'll write up exactly what each of those means or what it does. 

## Learn Python The Hard Way - Lesson review
