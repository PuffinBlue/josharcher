[LPTHW - Exercise 1](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex1.html)

Pretty simple introduction this, just a few print statements. Example code will be below the answers to the student questions...

```python
# print("Hello again!")
# print("I Like typing this.")
# print("This is fun.")
# print('Yay! Printing.')
# print("I'd much rather you 'not'.")
# print('I "said" do not touch this.')
print "This is another line."
```
## Learn Python The Hard Way Study Drills

### 1. Make your script print another line.

Done. See code (multiple print statements print multiple lines).

### 2. Make your script print only one of the lines.

Comment out all but one - done.

### 3. Put a # (octothorpe) character at the beginning of a line. What did it do? Try to find out what this character does

A '#' comments out a line meaning it won't be actioned by the interpreter.
