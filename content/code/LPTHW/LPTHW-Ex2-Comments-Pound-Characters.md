[LPTHW - Exercise 2](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex2.html)

Another gentle intro/recap of the first lesson. 

## Learn Python The Hard Way Study Drills

#### 1. Find out if you were right about what the # character does and make sure you know what it's called (octothorpe or pound character).

I was correct, it's 'comments out' code meaning it will be ignored by the interpreter. It's obviously called a hash sign too!

#### 2. Take your ex2.py file and review each line going backward. Start at the last line, and check each word in reverse against what you should have typed.

No mistakes.

#### 3. Did you find more mistakes? Fix them.

Nope!

#### 4. Read what you typed above out loud, including saying each character by its name. Did you find more mistakes? Fix them.

None!

```python
# A comment, this is so you can read your program later
# Anything after the # is ignored by python.

print "I could have code like this." # and the comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to 'disable' or comment out a piece of code:
# print "This won't run."

print "This will run."
```
