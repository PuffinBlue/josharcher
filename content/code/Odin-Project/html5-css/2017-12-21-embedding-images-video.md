This post covers my work on the [Embedding Images and Video assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/embedding-images-and-video) from the [HTML5 and CSS3 course](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3) from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

This assignment practices embedding images and video into a recreation of the YouTube video player page. The assignments main focus is on ensuring you learn how to embed media but it has the secondary effect of continuing to practice HTML structure and CSS layout techniques.

### What I learned

I increased my knowledge of the intricacies of using Flexbox to layout the page and ran into issues with making the layout responsive. 

### What I should improve

Future work should seek to improve responsive design from the inception, not attempt to add it once the majority of design decisions have been made. Further investigation into making embedded video responsive would also be useful.
