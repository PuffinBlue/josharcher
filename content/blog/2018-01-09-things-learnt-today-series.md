This is a simple series that's primarily going to be focused on incentivising learning and documenting what I do outside of my main aims for this year (LPTHW and Odin Project with a touch of CS thrown in).

Essentially, I'm keeping a Learning Journal, hence the category name these posts will reside within. 

### Format

I'm writing this mostly to remind myself:

* Short description or sentence on thing
* Link if applicable
* Short note on why it was useful if applicable
* Further blog post if suitable
* Photos where applicable

Learning points will be raised as separate headed sections within one daily coverage post.

### Constant Bearing, Decreasing Range (CBDR)

Well known in Nautical and Aviation circles. When two objects on different headings maintain the same relative bearing to each other - it will result in collision.

Worth remembering that the A pillar can thrown such a large shadow and to really look around it at junctions. Oh, and not blow through give way lines, that too.

### Basic audio editing with Audacity

An excellent overview of the interface and performing basic edits to remove noise, normalise, equalise etc etc:

There is also a handy [PDF guide](http://www.yorkmusicservice.co.uk/resources/downloads/AUDACITY_quick_guide.pdf) that covers more about importing, exporting, splitting, mixing etc etc. 

### Lighting setup for streaming

Loads of good resources out there that emulate what you might use in photography but with constant lights. 

One interesting tip was the addition of a 'tail light' on the back of a chair. Described fully in this video:

### Let Encrypt - how Certbot and TLS-SNI-01 authentication works

Saw this through a HackerNews post which lead to a bit of extra learning about how Let Encrypt and specifically Certbot handles authentication: 

[https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/2018-01-09-issue-with-tls-sni-01-and-shared-hosting-infrastructure/49996](https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/2018-01-09-issue-with-tls-sni-01-and-shared-hosting-infrastructure/49996)

I suspect a lot of these extra-curricular learning point might come from HackerNews!
