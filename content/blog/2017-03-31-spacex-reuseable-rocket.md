Yesterday, Thursday 30th March 2017 at 22:27GMT Space X launched a Falcon 9 rocket. This rocket had previously launched an orbital payload and successfully landed. Following the successful orbital insertion of a geostationary payload yesterday's rocket then successfully completed a boostback burn and landed on an autonomous drone ship in the Atlantic ocean. 

Let's just take a moment to understand what happened, because it's unbelievable.

Space X launched and landed a rocket in one mission, then used it again in a second mission to launch a payload - then relanded the rocket again. 

Let's let that sink in...

### Space X has achieved reusable, re-landable rocket flight. 

This is science fiction made reality. 

This is a milestone in human endeavour equal to the first powered flight or the manned space flight. It will echo down through history as an outstanding achievement that advances human technolgical progress.

Don't underestimate what has happened here. We may have been brought up on a diet of science fiction where such scenes are common place but these fantasites are labelled science fiction for a reason - they're outside our technological capabilities. 

Well, not any more. 

Space X has pushed forward space flight with this single event every bit as much as the Apollo moon landings did.

Yes. Really. That's how big a deal this is. 

### This is our generations Apollo landing

And there's more to come. Soon the Falcon 9 Heavy will launch and the first moves towards human flight to Mars will be taken with the Interplanetary Transport System.

I've often wished I was alive during the 60's and 70's to see mankinds great achievements. But they're happening right in front of us here and now. 

From quantum computers to self-driving cars to ubituitous renewable energy to commercial aviation to the internet - we're living in the greatest time of advancement and discovery in human history. 

This is it! This is what it feels like to live through such times, you're really living it! This is the stuff our children and grandchildren will ask us about when we're old and worn out. 

Enjoy it and revel in the incredible happening all around you.
