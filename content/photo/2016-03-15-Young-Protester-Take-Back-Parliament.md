A young girl protests during the 2010 [Take Back Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take_Back_Parliament) protest in London.

I shot this with a friend (though this is my image) and we did so purely for fun and for practice. The intent was to capture some strong images from the day that could stand on their own but worked well together to tell the story of the whole protest.

Everything was shot on the streets around Westminster and Whitehall. I shot on a single camera (D700) with 35mm f2 prime.
