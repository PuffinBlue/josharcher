I shot this nearly 6 years ago and I've always loved it since the second I took it. I have never shared it publicly before for fear of others not liking it. 

Thankfully I've reached a point in my photography 'journey' where I no longer worry about such things.

This was just a split second moment. The shot came together in half a second and was gone just as quickly. I didn't take anything else apart from this one shot, but for me it was a perfect moment. 

To me, it was everything the moment could have been and probably the first time I'd experienced that as a photographer. 

It was exhilarating.

I've definitely taken 'better' shots, but I'll always love this one.
